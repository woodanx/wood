	<section>
		<p>As Institutional Business development manager at Saxo Capital Markets I am responsible for sourcing and developing relationships to deliver Saxo's trading technology solutions to Financial Services companies. This can range from small API integrations up to customised white label solutions.</p>


		<p>My role has given me exposure to various types of clients from technology vendors, brokerage houses, Self-managed super fund providers and alternative asset managers. This has provided me with a well- rounded overview of the Australian market place and underlying client demands and needs when using e-commerce solutions internally as well as those provided to end clients.</p>


		<p>I am looking for a new challenge to take my career further and believe that my experience with well respected global institutions, known for delivering award winning technology to clients, and understanding of financial markets gives me the background to take on this role.</p>
